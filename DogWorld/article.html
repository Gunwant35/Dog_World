          <h1 class="l-heading">Intresting Facts about dogs</h1>
          <p>
            <li>Dogs can smell thousands of times better than humans. Their noses have millions more scent receptors—for
              example, a human nose averages five million, while a Dachshund’s nose has 125 million—making dogs useful
              for sniffing out drugs, dead bodies, bed bugs, explosives, and other things dogs can smell that humans
              can’t.</li>
            <li>Dogs’ sense of smell might be pretty amazing, but don’t forget about their hearing! Everything from the
              positioning of their ears to the muscles in them helps dogs pick up a whole host of sounds that humans
              can’t hear. In fact, the most popular explanation for why dogs tilt their heads is that they’re trying to
              locate the source of a sound.</li>
            <li>Dogs have approximately one sixth of the taste buds humans have (1,700 to humans’ approximately 9,000).
              This is why dogs will scarf rotting food scraps (or grass) as voraciously as they’ll eat a bowl of kibble
              or a hunk of steak. Their less discriminatory sense of taste also has to do with their evolutionary
              instincts, carried over from when they would scavenge in the wild.</li>
            <li>A dog’s nose is the equivalent of a human fingerprint, with each having a unique pattern of ridges and
              creases. Also find out the reason dogs’ noses are always wet.</li>
            <li>If you’ve ever noticed your pooch twitching in her sleep, this probably means she’s dreaming.
              Researchers found that dogs have similar sleep patterns and brain activity as humans, and that small
              breeds tend to dream more than large ones. Psychology Today suggests they’re probably imagining familiar
              activities like playing outside or chasing their tail. Learn more dog facts about dog dreams with these
              things you can learn just from your pup’s sleeping position.</li>

          <h3>benifits of having a dog</h3>
          Dogs can have many positive effects on the lives of their owners. They influence social, emotional, and
          cognitive development in children, promote an active lifestyle, provide companionship, and have even been able
          to detect oncoming epileptic seizures or the presence of certain cancers. Dogs can also help to relieve stress
          and anxiety in people. Around 38% of US households are estimated to have one or more dogs.

          Although dogs can be beneficial to the health and wellbeing of their owners, people should be aware that dogs
          of any age, including puppies, can sometimes carry harmful germs that can make people sick. Germs from dogs
          can cause a variety of illnesses, from minor skin infections to serious illnesses. One of the best ways you
          can protect yourself from getting sick is to thoroughly wash your hands after handling, caring for, feeding,
          or cleaning up after dogs.

          By providing your dog with routine veterinary care and following the Healthy People tips, you are less likely
          to get sick from touching or interacting with a dog.
