            </h3>
            <p>
              The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador Retriever is America's most popular dog breed. Labs are friendly,
              outgoing, and high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection to go around for a family
              looking for a medium-to-large dog. The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending on the sex,
              stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat
              comes in yellow, black, and a luscious chocolate. The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with kindliness, and
              the thick, tapering 'otter tail' seems to be forever signaling the breed's innate eagerness. Labs are
              famously friendly. They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, and they socialize
              well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don't mistake his easygoing personality for low energy: The
              Lab is an enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise, like swimming and marathon games of fetch,
              to keep physically and mentally fit.

            1. Labradors have webbed toes and are therefore great swimmers. This webbing can also effectively act as a
            snowshoe in colder climates, as it keeps snow from collecting between their toes.
            2. Their coat has two layers: a short, thick topcoat and a relatively water-resistant undercoat. This
            two-layer coat protects them from cold and wet weather.
            3. They are the most commonly used breed for guide dogs. They are intelligent, easy to train, eager to
            please and have a gentle temperament.
            4. Labradors are the most popular dog breed in America & the UK.
            5. This breed loves to be around people and needs a lot of affection, as well as plenty of exercise to burn
            off all that energy!
            6. Labradors have working roles in all sorts of sectors including search and rescue, therapy, hunting,
            assisting the disabled and tracking.

              The American Pit Bull Terrier is a companion and family dog breed. Originally bred to “bait” bulls, the
              breed evolved into all-around farm dogs, and later moved into the house to become “nanny dogs” because
              they were so gentle around children.

            The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from the
            extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the first
            species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.
